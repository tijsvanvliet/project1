    <div class="media-text">
        <P> Overwatch 2 is a hero shooter, where players are split into two teams and select a "hero"
            from a roster of 35
            characters.<br> Characters are organized into a "damage" class, responsible for offensive efforts; a
            "support"
            class,
            responsible for healing and buffing; and a "tank" class, responsible for the team's protection.<br> Each
            character
            has a
            unique set of skills, made up of active, passive, and ultimate abilities. Overwatch 2, like its predecessor,
            both
            primarily centers on player versus player (PvP) combat across several different modes and maps, and includes
            casual and ranked competitive matches.<br>
            2,
            the number of tank slots was reduced by one, bringing the total number of players per team to five.<br>
            According to
            game director Aaron Keller, developers hoped that losing a tank would speed up the gameplay as they believed
            The original Overwatch was designed for six-on-six team combat, with two of each class on a team. In
            Overwatch
            that
            the original six players scheme rendered gameplay slow.<br> It is also intended to ease the number of things
            players
            and
            spectators need to watch out for. New maps were designed to include more cover options to compensate for
            reduced
            tank-based protection.[1] Additionally, damage class heroes now have an increased movement speed, support
            heroes
            slowly regenerate, and tank heroes were redesigned so they could take on a more offensive role.<br> Heroes
            were
            visually
            refurbished to reflect the passage of time since the events of the first game.<br> [2] Overwatch 2 includes
            a ping
            system
            to direct the attention of teammates to specific points on the map.[3]
            The game also introduces a new PvP mode named "Push", similar to tug of war, in which teams vie for control
            of a
            robot that pushes a team's payload to the opponent's side of the map. Along with being incorporated into
            Unranked
            and Competitive play, Push has become part of the standard map rotation of the Overwatch League, replacing
            the
            Assault mode.<br> [4] Some existing gameplay modes may be dropped in Overwatch 2; former game director Jeff
            Kaplan
            has
            stated that some Assault maps (colloquially referred to as "2CP", meaning "two control points"), such as
            Paris
            and
            Horizon Lunar Colony, will likely not be available in Overwatch 2 as these have been deemed unbalanced in
            response
            to community feedback.<br> Other Assault maps, such as Hanamura and Temple of Anubis, may be available in
            the form
            of
            custom games or non-competitive arcade modes.[5]
            The game features player versus environment (PvE) game modes. Similar to the special seasonal events, they
            will
            consist of four-player cooperative missions against non-playable characters and are available on a permanent
            as
            opposed to a seasonal basis.<br> In this mode, players can garner experience points for their hero and
            unlock new
            passive abilities called "talents", allowing them to influence how the hero plays.<br> There are least two
            PvE
            modes; a
            story-based mission mode, where players are limited to their hero selection in replaying missions based on
            Overwatch
            lore, and Hero missions which allow all heroes to be used in fending off waves of enemies at various
            locations.<br>
            Blizzard anticipates that Overwatch 2 will offer over 100 different PvE missions, utilizing new maps as well
            as
            existing multiplayer maps expanded out to include new areas, and adding in dynamic effects, such as day and
            night
            times as well as varying weather conditions.<br> Enemy types are expanded out from the Null Sector robots
            that were
            introduced in the original seasonal PvE events, adding in new types with unique behaviors.<br>
            Overwatch 2 was released as free-to-play as opposed to the premium monetization model of its
            predecessor.<br> It
            also
            discontinued loot boxes in favor of a battle pass system which is offered on a seasonal basis and
            corresponds
            with
            the introduction of new maps and heroes.<br> The game also includes an in-game store where players can
            purchase
            cosmetics directly.<br> [7][8] Blizzard stated that new heroes will be introduced as rewards on the free
            tier of the
            battle pass, and players who fail to make the associated tier will have other routes to obtain the hero for
            free
            in
            later seasons.<br>
            A Battle.<br> net account is required to play Overwatch 2, regardless of platform.<br> Overwatch 2 features
            cross-progression, with in-game cosmetic items and progress being shared across PC and console versions.[10]
            Unlocked cosmetic items, in-game currency, and player statistics from any Overwatch profile linked to such
            an
            account are merged, and are available on all platforms.<br> Competitive skill ratings are separate, with
            console and
            PC
            ranks remaining independent of each other.<br> </P>
